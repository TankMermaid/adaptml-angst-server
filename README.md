adaptml-angst-servers
==============

**If you have an issue with AdaptML itself, please submit your issue at https://github.com/ladavid/adaptml**

These are the web frontend servers for AdaptML and AnGST

- The AdaptML server is at http://almlab.mit.edu/adaptml/
- The AnGST server is at http://almlab.mit.edu/angst/

AnGST and AdaptML are by Lawrence David (@ladavid).  I (@albertyw) wrote the (pretty crappy) server frontends.
